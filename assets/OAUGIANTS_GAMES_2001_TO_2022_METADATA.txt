##### DATA ENCODING & COLUMN DESCRIPTION							
**Date**	
*This is the date the match was played and format is in yyyymmdd. For matches affected by incomplete information, the information was coded to the point where data was available with the rest of unavailable information represented with consecutive zeroes. For example, 20201000 would refer to a match played in October of 2020 but the exact day was unknown.*

**TieDescr**

**HomeTeam**	
*Some competitions are in Home & Away format and in such cases, this column correctly indicates which team was the Home Team. Some single legged ties also have designated home teams by schedule but this holds no significance in such ties, however, for matches where this was unclear, OAU was mostly set to be the home team provided the match location did not have a relation to the opposition team (venue was potentially neutral ground to both teams).*

**MOTM**	
*Indicates who was named Man of The Match in the fixture. Info is only (mostly) added when an OAU player is the recipient of such award given the context of the data collection process.*
