This App would enable users to analytically view every player who participated in the 2023 FIFAWWC in AU-NZ by examining player-level detail. The analysis would be based on Statsbomb FREE data for the Women's World Cup. \nThe project was inspired by Ana Beatriz Macedo. You can have a look at her work [here](https://statsbombchartapp-anabeatrizmacedo.streamlit.app/)
